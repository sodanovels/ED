9. The quality of QuickTime™ playback depends on the speed of your processor, the speed of your CD-ROM drive and the amount of memory available for your PC. For more information about QuickTime™ and about audio and video compatibility, read the QuickTime™ for Windows ReadMe file. 
10. Problems with sound cards and video displays are often the result of faulty device drivers supplied by the manufacturer. Ensure that you have the most recent sound and video drivers for your computer.
